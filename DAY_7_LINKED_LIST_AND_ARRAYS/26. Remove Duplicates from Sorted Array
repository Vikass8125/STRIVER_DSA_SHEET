Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


HINTS:
We need to modify the array in-place and the size of the final array would potentially be smaller than the size of the input array. 
So, we ought to use a two-pointer approach here. One, that would keep track of the current element in the original array and another
one for just the unique elements.


Essentially, once an element is encountered, you simply need to bypass its duplicates and move on to the next unique element.

MY_SOLUTION

Solution 1: Brute Force

Intuition: We have to think of a data structure that does not store duplicate elements. 
So can we use a Hash set? Yes! We can. As we know HashSet only stores unique elements.

Approach: 

Declare a HashSet.
Run a for loop from starting to the end.
Put every element of the array in the set.
Store size of the set in a variable K.
Now put all elements of the set in the array from the starting of the array.
Return K.

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        //BRUTE FORCE -> USING HASH MAP
        
        int len = nums.length;
        if(len == 0) return 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            set.add(nums[i]);
        }
        int k = set.size();
        int j = 0;
        for (int x: set) {
            nums[j++] = x;
        }
        return k;    
    }
}

Time complexity: O(n*log(n))+O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) 


===============================================================

Solution 2: Two pointers

Intuition: We can think of using two pointers ‘i’ and ‘j’, we move ‘j’ till we don’t get a number arr[j] which is different from arr[i]. 
As we got a unique number we will increase the i pointer and update its value by arr[j]. 

Approach:

Take a variable i as 0;
Use a for loop by using a variable ‘j’ from 1 to length of the array.
If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
 After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.
 
 
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        
        if(len == 0) return 0;
        
        int i = 0;
        for(int j = 1; j < len ; j++){
            if(nums[j] != nums[i]){
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
        
    }
}

Space Complexity: O(1)
